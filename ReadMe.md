# Alien Invasion game

### Brief description

This project is from the book, Python Crash Course.

The Alien Invasion game is a simple 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens
as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. 

To create this game I used the PyGame package. I have also added modifications to make it 
more interesting

### More detailed description of gameplay

In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends
