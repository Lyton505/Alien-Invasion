# Alien Invasion game

This project is from the book, Python Crash Course.

The Alien Invasion game is a simple 2D game in which the aim is to shoot down a fleet of aliens
as they drop down the screen in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. 

To create this game I used the PyGame package. I have also added modifications to make it 
more interesting
